# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

![Design preview for the Order summary card coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj).

## The challenge

The challenge was to build an order summary card component (with hover states) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Where to find everything

Project designs can be found inside the `/design` folder. There are both mobile and desktop versions of the design.

All images are located in the `/images` folder.

Frontend Mentor proviced a `style-guide.md` file containing the information such as color palette and fonts.

## Building the project

1. Initialized project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/ePaulo/order-summary-component).
2. Looked at Desktop designs and to visualize use-once and repeat components.
3. Added structured content, with HTML tags, to html file based on visualized components.
4. Added base styles for the project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Added component styles to "outer" components and worked inward and down the page.
6. Refactored the CSS to remove unnecessary styles and group common styles with selectors grouping.

## Deploying project

Published on [GitHub pages](https://epaulo.github.io/order-summary-component/).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While only a "basic" project, it was still useful as I continued to gain experience planning for and writing responsive HTML/CSS code.
